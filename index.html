                <p class="NYG_intro_pgraph"> The New York Giants are a historic NFL franchise founded in 1925, remarkable for their tradition of toughness, resilience, and performing best on the biggest stages. Competing in the NFC East and representing New York, the Giants have built an identity around disciplined defense, physical play, and an ability to rise when expectations are low. Holding 4 superbowls and a historical league success, the Giants are well known for their ability to disrupt dominant opponents in their endeavors throughout history (unalike many franchises which show consistency overall as league dominators), rising as an underdog to defeat the clearly advantageous team. Despite their recent poor performances in the modern era, their new team led by Jaxson Dart is looking promising to lifelong fans, which haven't seen great success since the early 2010's. Overall, the Giants are one of the most commendable franchises in the league, and whilst their current performance is not the best, past successes define their career and a hopeful future could be what it takes to make NY great again.</p>

                    <h3 class="PhotoHeader">1. Superbowl XXI (1987)</h3>
                    <p> The 1986 Giants capped an outstanding season with a commanding 39–20 victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI, a game that etched names like Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor into Giants lore. Simms, who completed an astonishing 22 of 25 passes — one of the most efficient performances in Super Bowl history — carved up Denver’s secondary with precision and calm. Taylor, relentless as ever, anchored a defense that forced turnovers and applied constant pressure, limiting John Elway’s impact. A defining moment occurred when Simms connected with tight end Mark Bavaro and wide receiver Lionel Manuel for crucial gains in the fourth quarter, turning a close contest into a decisive advantage. By game’s end, the Giants’ balanced attack and stifling defense left no doubt: this was a team built for big moments.</p>

                    <p> In a contest defined by tension and attrition, the Giants edged out a 20–19 win over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV, showcasing grit under pressure. The slow, methodical offense orchestrated by Jeff Hostetler — stepping in for an injured Phil Simms — controlled the clock and kept the explosive Bills offense on the sidelines. Giants running back Ottis Anderson powered the ground game, grinding out tough yards and earning Super Bowl MVP honors. The defense, led by Lawrence Taylor and Michael Strahan, bent but rarely broke, forcing Buffalo into difficult situations. The final chapter of this game will forever be linked to Bills kicker Scott Norwood’s missed 47‑yard field goal attempt, wide right, with seconds remaining — a moment that epitomized the razor‑thin margin between victory and defeat.</p>

                    <p> In one of the greatest upsets in NFL history, the underdog Giants stunned the previously undefeated New England Patriots 17–14 in Super Bowl XLII, a game that hinges on one of the most iconic plays in football lore. With the Patriots threatening to extend their dominant run, Eli Manning escaped a near sack and delivered a miraculous 32‑yard strike to David Tyree, who pinned the ball against his helmet in what instantly became “The Helmet Catch.” That play flipped momentum and set up Plaxico Burress’s game‑winning touchdown reception in the final minute. Giants defenders like Mathias Kiwanuka and Michael Strahan disrupted New England’s rhythm throughout, but it was Manning’s poise — especially in crunch time — that defined this triumph, preserving its place among the most dramatic finishes in Super Bowl history.</p>

                    <p> Four years later, the Giants again faced the Patriots and emerged with a 21–17 victory in Super Bowl XLVI, reinforcing their reputation for late‑game magic. Eli Manning, again at the helm, engineered key scoring drives, including a pivotal 38‑yard completion to Hakeem Nicks that swung momentum and kept New England’s vaunted defense on its heels. The Giants’ relentless running back Ahmad Bradshaw punched in the decisive touchdown late in the fourth quarter, while the defense, led by players like Corey Webster, forced timely stops and turnovers. Even as the Patriots mounted their own comeback attempts, the Giants remained composed, sealing the win through balanced execution and calculated aggression. This victory reaffirmed New York’s knack for rising when it mattered most against their perennial rivals.</p>

            <h3> Jaxson Dart's statistics (25-26 season)</h3>
            <p>The statistics for Jaxson Dart this season show an efficient, volatile player with clear upside who has produced when protection and rhythm are established early in games. Dart's appearances have shown several spikes to the mid-60% completion range along with other high-efficiency games. For instance, he has thrown for over 70% completion with a passer rating over 100. That suggests he is a solid, accurate quarterback who can make plays with a compact throwing motion within structure. The yardage numbers show he can stretch the field. He has had multiple games above 200 passing yards. His best game came near 300 yards and three touchdowns. Despite Dart's great play, it was clear at time during games that he is a little inconsistent in lower output games. In those games, Jaxson Dart’s completion percentage dipped into the low 50s or below. Even more troubling, these games also featured interceptions and passer ratings that were sharply reduced. Overall, Dart seems to be a player that is susceptible to pressure and/or timing put off course. Overall, the statistical profile shows a quarterback capable of high-level performance under ideal conditions. He still requires improvement in ball security and consistency, however, two traits we commonly see in an unpolished player with a tangible long-term upside as opposed to a finished product.</p>
